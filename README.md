# Winter Term Project

**Description:** Our winter term project for OSU app development club!

For our winter term project, we decided on creating a retro online gaming website. This was both my partner's (Konrad) and my first time taking on a project of this sort. Before this, I (Kevin) had never really touched JavaScript or Git. In fact, this is our first repository!

## Games Developed

1. **Tic-Tac-Toe:**
   - We started with a simple tic-tac-toe game as our first project. Since neither of us had much experience in web development, we opted for something straightforward to get us started. Building this game helped us understand web development concepts better. I decided to implement this game from scratch without relying on tutorials, which was quite challenging but rewarding!

2. **Pong:**
   - For our second game, we chose to develop Pong, a classic arcade game. To learn the game logic and implement it using object-oriented programming, I followed a tutorial on pong logic in a different programming language called Processing. I converted the logic from Processing to JavaScript, which presented its own set of challenges. However, the effort was worth it as it deepened our understanding of game development.

3. **Snake:**
   - Although we didn't complete it on time, we decided on developing Snake as our third game. I spent the majority of my spring break working on it intermittently and managed to complete it. Unlike Pong, I didn't follow a specific tutorial for Snake. Instead, I researched how Snake works and implemented most of it myself, drawing inspiration from various examples. This project posed more challenges compared to Pong, but it was a valuable learning experience.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project was incredibly enjoyable and served as our first significant endeavor in web development. While we didn't secure a first-place position, we were proud to place third in the beginner category of the hackathon. Considering that this was our first experience in web development, we believe it was a commendable achievement!
