# wintertermproject
Our winter term project for OSU app development club! 

For our winter term project, we decided on making a sort of retro online gaming website! 
This was both me and my partner's (konrad) first time really taking on a project of this sort, before this I (kevin) have never really touched javascript or git for that matter. In fact this is both of our first repository! 

For our first game we decided to start off simple and build a simple tic-tac-toe game! We decided on this game because neither of us have really programmed web dev before so we wanted something to get us started off and this game definitely helped us understand web dev more! I decided to do this game from scratch without the help of any tutorials so it was a challenge!

The second game we decided to do something a little more challenging, pong! For this one I did end up following a tutorial on pong logic in a different programming language called processing [link](https://www.instructables.com/Pong-With-Processing/), I decided on this because I wanted to do pong with object-oriented programming and this was the only tutorial I could find that made pong in such a way, converting the logic from processing to javascript was a challenge, but worth it! 

Unfortunately, we did not get a third game done on time, to be honest tic-tac-toe took up way more time than it should have, however I hope to implement a snake game during spring break (hopefully).
