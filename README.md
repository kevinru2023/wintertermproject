# wintertermproject
Our winter term project for OSU app development club! 

For our winter term project we decided on making a sort of retro online gaming website! 
This was both me and my partner (konrads) first time really taking on a project of this sort, before this I (kevin) have never really touched javascript or git for that matter. In fact this is both of our first repository! 
Don't ask us how long it took us to make the tic tac toe game.
